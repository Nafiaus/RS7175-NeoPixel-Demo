This is a Demo Project for Radioshack. When you push the button the LEDs will cycle through 3 different light modes. You may add more if you want as well!

Adafruit Objects Used:
Product ID: 	Name of Product										Object Website
2860		NeoPixel Jewel - 7 x 5050 RGBW LEDs w/Intergrated Drivers - Cool White - ~6000k		https://www.adafruit.com/product/2860
2853		NeoPixel Ring - 12 x 5050 RGBW LEDs w/Intergrated Drivers - Cool White - ~6000k		https://www.adafruit.com/product/2853

You may use any tactile button you want, and any arduino device to run the code.

Wire the Data Input on 2860 to the Data Output on 2853 then Data Input on 2853 goes to desired Output pin on Arduino.
Wire the GND on all devices together and send to ground on the Arduino.
Wire the 5v Power to all devices and send to 5v on Arduino. (You also may use the 3.3v Power Pin)'
